+ Unix filesystems
	• Everthing is file on unix.
	• A filesystem is the methods and DS than an OS uses to keep track of files on physical disk.
	• The central concepts are superblock, inode , data block, directory block , and indirection block. 
	• Superblock contains metadata for filesystems, inode contain meta data for files.

+ Superblock :-
	• Blocks in the file system
	• No of free blocks in the file system
	• Inodes per block group
	• Blocks per block group
	• No of times the file system was mounted since last fsck.
	• Mount time 
	• UUID of the file system
	• Write time
	• File System State (ie: was it cleanly unounted, errors detected etc)
	• The file system type etc(ie: whether its ext2,3 or 4).
	• The operating system in which the file system was formatted

+ Read about superblock corruption and backup copy.
+ How to check contents of superblock.

+ Where the filename is stored
	• In most Unix-based file systems, the filename is stored as a name/inode lookup table in the "data" section of the directory containing the file (	  that is, the space on the disk where a normal file would store its data).


+ Inode number :-
	• Inode number also called as index number
	• File types ( executable, block special etc )
	• Permissions ( read, write etc )
	• UID ( Owner )
	• GID ( Group )
	• FileSize
	• Time stamps including last access, last modification and last inode number change.
	• File deletion time
	• Number of links ( soft/hard )
	• Location of file on harddisk.
	• Some other metadata about file.

+ Directory block :-
