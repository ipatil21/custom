Coding Challenge – Problem Statement


Dog Shelter:
Mr. Singhania has opened a shelter for orphan dogs. To ensure their well-being, he hired N expert care-takers. Each care taker works in shifts to cover certain overlapping intervals of day time. 
Consider that the shelter is open from time 0 until time 10^9 (1000000000) each day. Each care taker shift can be described by two integers i.e. start time and end time. For example, if start time t=4 and end time t=7 the care taker covers 3 units of time.
Unfortunately, Mr. Singhania had losses in stock market and has to cut down K care takers to cover losses. You need to write a program to calculate the maximum amount of time that can be covered by remaining care takers (after removing K care takers). At least one care taker should be present at any point in this covered time. Below are the input and output file formats for your program.

Input file caretakers.in:
The first line is N and K separated by space, where:
 : 1≤K≤N
 : N≤100000
 : K≤100
Each next N lines are start and end times of caretakers (two integers in the range 0…10^9 (1000000000)). Shifts of different caretakers can overlap.

Output file caretakers.out:
Single number giving the maximum amount of time that can still be covered after removing K caretakers.

SAMPLE INPUT:
3 2
6 13
12 20
7 19

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
12
In this example, the below caretakers should be removed 6…13 and 12…20.
